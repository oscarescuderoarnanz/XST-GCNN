# Project Directory Structure

## Baselines
This folder contains the baseline models used to compare against our proposed architecture. These models serve as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of our approach.

## DATA
This directory contains the original data, which is private and not publicly accessible due to confidentiality restrictions, as it includes information about real patients.

## XST-GNN_Architecture (XST-GCNN)
This folder holds our main architecture, XST-GCNN, which was developed and refined to outperform the baseline models. All relevant scripts and configurations for this architecture are located here.
